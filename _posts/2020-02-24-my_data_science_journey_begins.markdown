From a very young age, I have always wanted to change society for the better and have spent majority of my life helping others get through struggles, celebrate life, and evoke emotion through music. This in itself is a language that I can say I have achieved fluency in.
This powerful language has undoubtedly affected the world and human culture on many levels.

What a beautiful time to be alive! It goes without me having to say that data has become the most important thing driving technology, finance, and several other major industries. I developed a love of technology from a very young age and it was only a matter of time before I decided to dive into the world of Data Science.

One cold October morning in Tokyo, 2019 , I woke up after a night of adventure with a feeling that I could do more to change the world around me. I had a period of meditation followed by serious thought to myself in my AirBnb. Afterwards, I followed my heart and spent the entire day researching how AI has impacted society, projections on how it may shape our future, and what skills are required to create AI algorithms. This is where my journey began.

After looking through hours of YouTube tutorials, getting acquainted with PyCharm, and getting used to my computer’s command prompt, I understood the very basics of Python. This includes everything from variables, using for loops, and creating functions to operate simple tasks.

From that day in that AirBnb where I binged DS (data science) content, I added coding to my daily routine of content to study. Since then, I downloaded DataCamp and spent hours learning but eventually felt that it was a great step but was not enough for me to become as proficient as I would like to be. I saw videos online about people joining coding boot camps but the idea seemed silly. “I taught myself music AND Japanese. I’ll stick to self-study for $free.99.", I thought. After a few more weeks of consideration, I started to research more about boot camps, DS certifications, and acknowledged how hard it would be to find work as someone who does not have a computer science master’s degree, let alone a computer science degree at all. Taking many things into consideration, I accepted that I could give a boot camp a try. A friend of mine, recommended a few different schools and one stuck out to me once I researched them. That turned out to be Flatiron School. I spend most of my time in New York and thought it would not be feasible to actively attend class 5 days out of the week BUT I read about their full-time online Data Science Program. My heart melted and I looked into reviews, real testimonials, and made up my mind. I prepared myself to join the school with their free online content, did great on my technical entrance examination, and took the next step in my DS journey.
